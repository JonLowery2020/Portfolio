          <h4>Hi, Im Jonathan. Nice to meet you</h4>
          <p>I am a self taught developer, who enjoys the journey of learning and building. I began coding after studying UX design. I found that the best way for a user to have a great experience is to make sure that the application is functional and simple to use. I am consistantly learning by bulding projects and solving projects.</p>
